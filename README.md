## React Native Todo

React Native / redux implementation of Todo app

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:slightlytyler/react-native-todo.git
cd react-native-todo
npm install
```

## Development

```bash
npm run hot
open ./ios/ReactNativeReduxTodo.xcodeproj
```

Cmd+R inside Xcode to run the app in the iOS simulator. On first run, you'll likely receive an error because, in order for hot-loading to work, you need to be debugging in Chrome. Dismiss the error (press escape), then press Cmd+D and click on the Debug in Chrome button. When the Chrome debugger is open and connected, press Cmd+R in the iOS simulator to reload the app. You should now be hot-loading, and all changes you save in your source should update in the app.
